PSR-3 logging with Monolog
==========================

Pro:
* Supported by major frameworks
* Many appenders/handlers

Cons:
* Does not seem to have a Logger hierarchy like Log4php
* Does not seem to have MDC capabilities like Log4php
* Does not seem to have a standard way of externalizing the configuration like Log4php
* Does not seem to have advanced formatting like "%-6level" like Log4php
